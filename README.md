# libopenpmd

A WIP project to write an open-source C library capable of parsing both the MML and the compiled versions of the PMD
sound driver's music files.

The aim is to write a stripped-down, cross-platform - Windows, macOS, Linux and DOS on actual PC-98s - library for
parsing and handling PMD files. This goal is being approached by doing a from-the-ground-up, hopefully clean effort to
understand and document the binary formats based on my own experiments with the official manual and compiler with the
help of prior documentation efforts.

## Roadmap

- [ ] - Not started
- [D] - Not working
- [C] - Can fully parse existing file
- [B] - Can properly modify & overwrite existing file
- [A] - Can generate file from scratch, either empty or from supplied data
- [x] - Implemented to a satisfactory degree

---

* [ ] Handle PMD-related bank formats
  * [A] P86
  * [ ] PPS
  * [ ] PPC
  * [ ] PVI
  * [ ] PZI
  * [ ] FF
  * ... Other, non-PC-98 bank formats
* [ ] Handle PC-98 PMD modules
* [ ] Handle PC-98 MML files
* -> A PC-98 PMD compiler (reasonably accurate to the original one) & decompiler

### Further ideas

* Support for non-PC-98 module & MML formats?
  * IBM PC
  * FM Towns
  * X68000
  * PX
* An expanded PMD syntax & custom PMD version?
* A PMD module space optimiser? (e.g. loop analysis & unrolling)
* A new PMD player???

## Current status

I'm redoing the codebase. I'll start with smaller, more urgent goals like the various sample / patch bank formats to get
a better feel for the language & platform limitations.
